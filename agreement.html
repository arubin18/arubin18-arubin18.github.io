                      <li>
                          By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Newspark on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Newspark, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Newspark by someone else.

                      <li>
                          Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Newspark. You and Newspark agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Newspark, and not in a court of law.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          You acknowledge and agree that you and Newspark are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and Newspark otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and Newspark each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

                                  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in accordance with the AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA&rsquo;s at 1-800-778-7879.

                                  The parties agree that the arbitrator (&quot;Arbitrator&quot;), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1 et seq. (&quot;FAA&quot;), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of New York.
                              </li>
                          </ol>

                      <li>
                          Process. &nbsp;A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of New York and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&#39;s roster of commercial dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

                      <li>
                          Location and Procedure. Unless you and Newspark otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Newspark submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Arbitrator&#39;s Decision. The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&#39;s individual claim. An Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#39; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Newspark will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Newspark may have under applicable law to recover attorneys&#39; fees and expenses if Newspark prevails in arbitration.

                      <li>
                          Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Newspark will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

                      <li>
                          Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions in Section I above, regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms, if Newspark changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Newspark written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &quot;Effective&quot; date above. This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, c/o Newspark Technologies, Inc. (the name and current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online here), or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: founders@Newspark.US. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Newspark in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms).

                          Severability and Survival. If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties&rsquo; ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

                          Each party shall act as an independent contractor and shall have no authority to obligate or bind the other in any respect, and nothing in this Agreement shall create any partnership, joint ventures, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party shall make any statement, whether on their Sites or otherwise, that reasonably would contradict anything in the paragraph.&nbsp;

                          THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN MADE IN AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND NEW YORK STATE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO RULES GOVERNING CHOICE OF LAWS.

                          The provisions of this Agreement are independent of and separable from each other, and no provision shall be affected or rendered invalid or unenforceable by virtue of the fact that for any reason any other or others of them may be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part. You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.&nbsp;

                      <li>
                          Equitable Relief. The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties&rsquo; obligations regarding Marks, confidentiality, and/or user data may result in irreparable injury for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of a party&rsquo;s obligations regarding Marks, confidentiality, and/or user data, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;

Such temporary service interruptions will not constitute a material breach of this Agreement. Newspark and Newspark will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the services contemplated under this Agreement and to remedy any temporary interruptions or other problems that adversely affect the Platform.&nbsp;
